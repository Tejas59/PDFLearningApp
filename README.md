```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Create a .env file with the following variables
```bash
APP_PORT=8080
APP_PREFIX_PATH=/api
DB_URI=<Your MongoDB connection string>
DB_NAME=pdf-learning-app
JWT_SECRET=<Your JWT secret>
GEMINI_API_KEY=<Your Google Gemini/AI key>
```
4. start the backend:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind CSS)
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
```bash
cd frontend
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash

### How Itâ€™s Built

* RAG answers with citations

* YouTube Videos Recommendor

### Use of any LLM tools? For what purposes?.
I have used the LLM tools like chatGpt, gemini to understand the concepts of different library like zustand, Tanstack query, and different component and for the code generation I have also used the Copilot for code generation.
